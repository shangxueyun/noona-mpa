					</p>
					<p class="desc indent">
						<b>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction.</b>These Terms, their subject matter and their formation, including any arbitration proceeds outlined below, are governed by New York law.<br />
						<b>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b>
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. <b>You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</b><br />
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and noona, you will first contact noona and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.<br />
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Noona’s services and/or products, including the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and noona or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and noona. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by noona for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Services by following the procedure described below.<br />
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and noona are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with noona and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to noonaapp@gmail.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Services.
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						<b>Class Action Waiver: Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</b>
					</p>
					<p class="desc indent2">
						If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and noona each waive any right to a jury trial.
